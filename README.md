# Pupperdex - the PokÃ©dex for Puppies

This is the starter project to help you build out a "Pupperdex" application with AWS Amplify.

The UI code is written, all you have to do is add the backend logic. Code along based on this [Twitch stream](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/824360476?filter=all&sort=time). 

Clone the backend data model using the Amplify Sandbox and deploy to AWS.
